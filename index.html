			<p>The golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) is one of the best-known birds of prey in the Northern Hemisphere. Golden eagles maintain home ranges or territories that may be as large as 200 km<sup>2</sup> (77 sq mi). They build large nests in cliffs and other high places to which they may return for several breeding years.</p>
